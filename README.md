# ðŸ§  Next.js Learning Project

This is a learning project built with **Next.js 13+ (App Router)** to explore and demonstrate core concepts including routing, data fetching, layouts, server and client components, suspense, and more.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure & Features

### ðŸ§­ Navigation
- A `Header` component is included and reused in the layout.
- Navigation across:
  - `/` - Home
  - `/posts` - Posts list
  - `/articles` - Articles section

### ðŸ“„ Pages and Components

#### `/posts`
- **Server Component**
- Fetches post data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- Uses `fetch()` with `revalidate: 10` to demonstrate Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Each post is linked to `/posts/[id]`

#### `/posts/[id]`
- Displays post details based on dynamic `postId`
- Includes:
  - 2-second artificial delay using `setTimeout` to simulate loading
  - Suspense fallback UI (`LoadingPostDetails`)
  - `revalidate: 10` for fresh data every 10 seconds

#### `/articles`
- Articles page with nested routing
- Includes:
  - `articles/page.jsx` â€“ main articles page
  - `articles/features/page.jsx` â€“ features section
  - `articles/[title]/page.jsx` â€“ dynamic route for article titles

#### `/components/Todo.jsx`
- **Client Component** using `"use client"`
- Demonstrates:
  - `useEffect()` for fetching API data
  - `useState()` for managing fetched data
  - Error handling for failed requests

## ðŸ§© Layout & Styling

- Shared `layout.jsx` for articles section
- Basic inline styles used for all elements
- Spinner implemented via inline styles and `@keyframes` in JSX
